# Tracking Yosemite National Park Snow Cover Change

This ongoing project, deeply personal to me, focuses on monitoring snow cover changes in Yosemite National Park. Having spent every summer of my childhood in Yosemite Valley, I hold a deep connection to the area and its environmental challenges. 

In this project, I am using Google Earth Engine (GEE), JavaScript, Python, and R to explore changes in snow cover and investigate the implications to water resources.
